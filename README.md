# mocha_selenium_example    
I am a java automation test developer(selenium), 
This is my first trying to use mocha and javascript with selenium. 
I am doing some comparison between javascript selenium and java selenium.
I want to share the information with all automation testers who are selecting tools.

For Java selenium: mvn + testng + browerstack + jenkins   
For Javascript: mocha + node.js + browserstack + circleCI
For python: robotFramework + jenkins
